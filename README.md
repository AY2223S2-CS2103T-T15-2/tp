* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `FitBook` because it tracks the membership detail for Personal Training customers.
## Adapted from AddressBook-Level3
