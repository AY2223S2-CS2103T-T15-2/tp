<h2><div markdown="span" style="color:#f9963f">About FitBook</div></h2>

FitBook is a **desktop app for managing clients, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Fitbook can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This User Guide provides brief documentation on how you can install the application and describes how each feature should be used. Start by looking at the [quick start](#quick-start) guide to get you started.

<h2><span style="color:#f9963f">Quick start</span></h2>

1. Ensure you have **Java** `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. **Download** the latest `fitbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/releases).

1. **Copy** the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your FitBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar fitbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `listClients` : Lists all Clients.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 w/50 g/M` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the FitBook.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `export` : Exports all Client's details in FitBook into a csv file.

   * `exportRoutine` : Exports all Routine details in FitBook into a csv file.

   * `addRoutine r/Cardio ex/3x5 1km Jog ex/3x10 Jumping Jacks` : Adds a new routine named `Cardio` with 2 exercises `3x5 1km Jog` and `3x10 Jumping Jacks`.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.


1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2><span style="color:#f9963f">Features</span></h2>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Client list can be found in the Client panel. Routine list can be found in the Routine Panel of the `Routine` tab.

<h2><span style="color:#f9963f">FAQ</span></h2>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous FitBook home folder.

**Q**: Must I exit the FitBook app through the `exit` command?<br>
**A**: There is no need to exit the FitBook app through the `exit` command as everything is saved after each action changes to the list.

**Q**: Why can I not tag the exercise routine to the client?<br>
**A**: The exercise routine is probably not inside the list of routines or the routine name is wrong. The routine name is case-sensitive.
